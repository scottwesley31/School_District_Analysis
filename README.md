# School District Analysis
Module 4

## Overview of the school district analysis
### Purpose
After the compilation of data contained in two different csv files (`schools_complete.csv` and `students_complete.csv`) and an in-depth analysis of a school district's reading and math scores by grade, the school board discovered a dishonest reporting of ninth-grade math scores for one high school in particular - Thomas High School (THS). The school board is requesting an updated analysis of the school district data which excludes said math scores but keeps the rest of the data intact. A report describing how the updataed analysis has affected the overall school district results has been requested.

## Results
- How is the district summary affected?
- How is the school summary affected?
- How does replacing the nenth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools?
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade
  - Scores by school spending
  - Scores by school size
  - Scores by school type
